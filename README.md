# VOCC_Simulations_Winter2026

Readme being updated as project progresses.

## Final Goal of Project

Using AIMD methodology, simulate desorption process to yield Energy curve and using K2-SURF models, calculate relevant desiarable variables.

- k<sub>D</sub> Desorption Rate Constant (s<sup>-1</sup> Using the K2-SURF Arrhenius Equation)
- k<sub>A</sub> Adsorption Rate Constant (This is found using published values of the Henry's Law Constant of various PAHs and VOCs with Simualted values of k<sub>D</sub>)
- Predictive Persistence Lifetime (Found through data mapping of simulated energies to experimentally known persistence lifetimes of experimentally tested VOCs and applying model to untested VOCs through simulation.)
