# VOCC_Simulations_Winter2026
COEUS HPC VOCC Simulation Research for Dr. Gall with the help of Dr. Xia using principles of AIMD simulation techniques using Quantum Espresso for DFT calculations. Goal of this project is to model adsorption of VOCCs on various substrates and model a proxy material for soot and test adsorption.
